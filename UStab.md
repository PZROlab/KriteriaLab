# Master Specification: WikiLocal Architecture & Structure

## 1. System Overview
**WikiLocal** is an adaptive ecosystem designed to transform static files into a **Living Organism**. The system does not store files in a traditional manner; instead, it manages "seats" of knowledge linked to a source network.

## 2. Bio-Hierarchy (Vertical Architecture)

| Biological Level | Technical Component | Functional Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Organism** | `WikiLocal` | The complete system integrating one or multiple Vaults; the highest life unit. |
| **Cell (Cédula)** | `Folder` | Container environment defining identity and boundaries for each knowledge unit. |
| **Genome** | `Note (.md)` | Base code where raw or descriptive information resides. |
| **Chroma / Strand** | `Vector Database` | The system's DNA; enables information to be readable and connected for the AI. |
| **Metasome / Gene** | `Metadata + Links` | The minimum functional unit. Contains links to original files and identification metadata. |

## 3. Operational Dynamics: Query Motors
WikiLocal's operation is governed by two main metabolic processes:

* **Query-Ingest (Input Motor):**
    * **Function:** Creates Vault content through Metasome generation.
    * **Mechanics:** Upon detecting changes, it triggers **Mitosis**, replicating the Cell and archiving the previous state as a "fossil record."
* **Query-Wiki (Search Motor):**
    * **Function:** Executes relational searches across the entire WikiLocal to return contextual answers.
    * **Scoping:** Always operates on the most evolved state (the latest active Chroma).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Technical Module: Chroma (Chromosome) & Cell Architecture

## 1. Operational Core Definition
In this layer, the **Cell (Cédula)** acts as the core where the system's defining identity comes to life. It is based on the **Chroma** as the compact unit for storage and relational organization.

## 2. Biological RAG Components
This architecture is designed for a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system:

* **Chroma (Chromosome) - The Vector Map:**
    * **Function:** Not limited to static data storage; acts as the map of highly organized vector relationships.
    * **Technical Equivalent:** Represents the "DNA" of knowledge, allowing semantic search based on the information graph structure.
* **Cell (Cédula) - The Identity Instance:**
    * **Function:** The operational unit that uses the Chroma to determine its own identity and response capability.
    * **Scope:** Precisely defines the query purpose and sets the system's action boundaries.
* **Metasomes - Structural Units:**
    * **Composition:** Integrated by metadata and links.
    * **Dynamics:** Act as "bricks" that, when packaged within the Chroma, ensure efficient, structured, and fast retrieval.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Operational Module: Saturation & Perturbation Process (SPP)

## 1. Activation Phase: Approximation (Proximal)
* **Structure:** Formed by approximation "peaks."
* **Composition:** Contains a specific amount ($x$) of information **traces**.
* **Critical Threshold:** Upon reaching the defined number of approximations, the system automatically triggers the **Saturation** phenomenon.

## 2. The Phenomenon: Saturation
* **Technical Manifestation:** Appears as a dense line of **Metasomes**.
* **Strand Nature:** At this point, information is defined as **ADU** or **Chroma**.
* **The Gene (Identity Unit):** Metadata + Links are compiled into a **Gene**, acting as the unique identifier for the file/entity.

## 3. The Consequence: Perturbation
* **Change Mechanics:** Caused by the **transmutation of a Gene** due to extreme connective saturation.
* **Systemic Impact:** Results in the **redefinition of the reference** for the file or segment, forcing the system to evolve its relational map.

> **Flow Summary:** Approximation $\rightarrow$ Saturation $\rightarrow$ Perturbation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Evolution Module: Mitosis & Immutability Protocol

## 1. Evolution Mechanics
The system rejects direct editing in favor of **specialized replication**. The Cell is never overwritten; it evolves to preserve historical integrity.

## 2. Mitotic Process Phases
1. **Activation (Trigger):** Query-ingest detects a connective change in the data strand.
2. **Integrity Replication:** The current **Chroma** is fully duplicated to ensure an exact backup of the previous state.
3. **State Differentiation:**
    * **Cell/Old (Latency):** The previous state moves to a "fossil record." It is ignored by Query-wiki to eliminate redundancy.
    * **Cell/Resultant (Active):** The new instance inherits the connection and becomes the primary operational node.

## 3. Lineage Nomenclature (Traceability)
Example: `Cell_v1` $\rightarrow$ `Cell_v2_M1` (Mitosis 1) $\rightarrow$ `Cell_v3_M2` (Mitosis 2).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Adaptive Intelligence: Query-Ingest Physiology

## 1. Data as Perturbation (Pathogen)
* **Semantic Tension:** New data creates a "deformation" when it doesn't fit pre-existing categories.
* **Evolutionary Engine:** Perturbation is necessary; without this informational "stress," the Vault stagnates.

## 2. Absorption & Specialization Dynamics
* **Logical Division:** When information pressure exceeds the Cell's "membrane" capacity, it triggers Mitosis, splitting into smaller functional units.
* **Strand Sequencing:** The pathogen is assimilated into the DNA (Note), solidifying new knowledge.

## 3. Operational Ontology (Vault Scars)
The system's true intelligence lies in its transformation history. The **Trace as Structure** provides the context and "character" of the Vault by recording how folders mutated or divided.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Functional Module: Thought Flow & Multimodal Ingest

## 1. Processing Capabilities (Thinking)
The system does not merely execute; it processes through a critical reasoning layer.
* **Adaptive Reasoning:** Internal evaluation to determine the optimal resolution methodology for a command or query.
* **Context Detection:** Dynamic identification of folders, documents, and files to generate variable relationships between them.

---

## 2. Ingest & Tools (Multimodal Ingest)
The organism possesses the capacity to assimilate external stimuli heterogeneously.
* **Multimodal Ingest:** Resolution of free mixes of text and links in any order within a single instruction.
* **Function Calling:** Native accessibility to structures and tools, enabling automated and precise workflows.

---

## 3. Functional Analogy: Tools as Genes
To maintain consistency with the **Bio-Hierarchy**, the system's tools are classified under the following logic:
> Tools and functions operate as **Agents / Genes**, functional units that dictate the behavior and response capabilities of the digital organism when faced with a data perturbation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Integration Module: The Chromosome as Instruction Package

## 1. Structural Definition (Chromosome)
The **Chromosome** is established as the superior packaging structure within the WikiLocal.
* **Master Container:** Groups a specific set of **Metasomes** (metadata) and **Genes** (functions/tools).
* **Capability Unit:** Acts as the complete instruction package defining what a specific Agent can or cannot do.

---

## 2. Workflow Dynamics
The Chromosome is not static; it activates according to the context detected by the system.
* **Relationship Inheritance:** When the *Multimodal Ingest* detects files and generates links, the Chromosome automatically inherits these relationships.
* **Function Governance:** Determines the validity of **Function Calls**, allowing the AI to know which tools are permitted based on the biological context of the query.

---

## 3. Operational Hierarchy Synthesis
Under this model, the interaction is summarized as:
1. **Metasomes/Genes:** Data bricks and functional skills.
2. **Chromosome:** The software/DNA that packages them and provides purpose.
3. **Agent:** The phenotypic expression (action) executed by the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Application Concept: WikiLocal Operational Goals

## 1. Core Objective
The primary goal is to develop the **WikiLocal** app, an ecosystem where information is treated as a living entity.

## 2. Vault Functionality (MFL - Master File Link)
* **Storage Logic:** The Wiki vault stores shortcuts (MFL) to folders and files rather than duplicating raw data.
* **Linkage:** These shortcuts contain the binding to the original file combined with identification metadata.
* **Metasome Integration:** Metadata + Links serve as the bridge between the original source and the AI's relational map.

## 3. Structural Composition
* **Vaults (MFL):** Contain the "seats" of Metasomes.
* **Source Network:** The original location of the files, which remains preserved and connected.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Core Philosophy: The Living Vault

## 1. Information as an Organism
This conceptual framework moves beyond static file management to an evolutionary system.
* **Active Status:** Information is not just "stored"; it is a functional part of a larger life unit.

## 2. Key Vertical Principles
* **Immutability:** The history of the WikiLocal is never lost; it is archived within "old cells."
* **Traceability:** Thanks to the mitosis numbering, users can pinpoint exactly when a connection emerged in the organism's evolution.
* **Isolation:** Since each Cell (Cédula) is an independent folder, the Query-wiki always operates on the most "evolved" state (the latest active Chroma).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# System Summary: The Bio-Digital Synergy

## 1. The Power of the Metasome
The "Metasome" is the architectural key.
* **Data Decoupling:** By separating metadata and links (Metasome) from the pure content (Genome), the LLM can map relationships without getting lost in dense text.

## 2. Adaptive Framework
The combination of **Query-Ingest** and **Query-Wiki** ensures a metabolism that:
* **Asimilates:** New data via the ingest motor.
* **Reflects:** The current state of knowledge via the wiki motor.
* **Evolves:** Through constant mitosis and re-profiling activity.

> **Final Vision:** A healthy Vault is not one that is statically ordered, but one that shows constant activity of mitosis and structural adaptation.
